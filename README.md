# divwind
This is an NCL program to calculate divergent wind components
It requires U and V wind files. First calculates divergence, then calculates u and v divergent wind components, then outputs as netcdf files.
Code is based on publicly available code found here: https://www.ncl.ucar.edu/Applications/wind.shtml
